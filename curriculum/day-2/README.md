- game screen where you will play the game
- must use an input field as the method of response
- custom styling (tailwind recommended)

you can choose whatever you want for the content of the game. Below are some ideas.

- preset trivia questions
- [stroop effect](https://freebrainagegames.com/stroop.html#), where you type out the color of the text displayed
